# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Package renamed to `vue-advanced-odontogram` (was `vue-odontogram-editor-modul`).

### Added
- npm library packaging: `dist/` ESM/CJS bundles, TypeScript declarations, and `style.css` export (import `vue-advanced-odontogram/style.css` in host apps).
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/publish.yml` for tag-triggered and manual npm publishes.
- `NPM_PUBLISH.md` with one-time setup, local verification, and release checklist.
- README repositioned as the Vue 3 npm port of [React Odontogram Modul](https://github.com/ZoliQua/React-Odontogram-Modul), with npm install examples and upstream/demo links.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-23
### Added
- **Arabic (`ar`)** as the 10th UI language: full translation of every i18n key (`src/i18n/translations-ar.ts`), added to the topbar language switcher and Settings modal, with localized `language.ar` display name in all languages.
- RTL layout: selecting Arabic sets `dir="rtl"` and `lang="ar"` on `<html>` (restored to LTR when switching away).
- New `lang/README-ar.md` (Arabic README); 🇸🇦 العربية entry added to every README language switcher.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-23
### Changed
- **Breaking:** Migrated the UI shell from React 18 to **Vue 3.5**. The imperative odontogram engine (`odontogram.ts`, registry, FHIR, assets, tests) is unchanged; only the topbar/settings shell was rewritten as Vue SFCs (`App.vue`, `SettingsModal.vue`).
- Package renamed to `vue-odontogram-editor-modul`. Library entry is now `src/index.ts` (default export `OdontogramShell`, named engine API re-exports).
- Dev bootstrap moved to `src/main.ts`; `index.html` mounts `#app`.
- i18n hook replaced with a Vue composable (`useI18n`) backed by the same module-level singleton.
- UI tests migrated from React Testing Library to `@vue/test-utils`.

### Removed
- React, React DOM, and all React-specific tooling/deps.
- DentalQuoteCreator / React host integration paths (standalone Vue library going forward).

## [1.30.0] - 2026-07-11
### Fixed
- Peri-implant status (mucositis / peri-implantitis mild / moderate / severe) is now written to the exported chart. It was authored, rendered, summarized, and read back on import, but was omitted from `serializeState()`, so it was silently lost on JSON and FHIR export → import. It now round-trips like every other clinical axis (no payload-version change — additive and backward-compatible within 2.10).
### Changed
- Comprehensive documentation refresh. The README (English + all supported UI languages) now covers every clinical axis and setting added since v1.13 — pulp / apical diagnosis (with practical-Latin subtypes), root resorption, peri-implant status, the caries state-machine (ICDAS depth, CARS secondary caries, root caries, radiographic depth), per-surface filling defects, typed tooth wear, discoloration, per-tooth orthodontics, position-aware surface notation, the two-axis restoration model with removable prosthetics and multi-tooth bridge spans, and the tabbed Settings modal. The Status Export/Import field reference and payload version (2.10) are brought current, and the generated API reference (TypeDoc) is regenerated.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-07-11
### Fixed
- Changing the pulp-detail level (Settings) now live-refreshes the whole-mouth summary and per-tooth tooltips (previously stayed stale, showing the old Latin/AAE wording until the next tooth edit).
- Crown-leakage ("Marginal leakage") no longer shows in the tooltip or whole-mouth summary once a tooth's restoration control is hidden (radix/milktooth/extraction/under-gum) or its restoration is cleared — the summary gate now matches the `#crownLeakageRow` control's own visibility gate (`!restorationRowHidden(state)` AND `restorationType` crown/bridge) exactly, including for stale crown/bridge payloads reached via import/hydrate.
- Lower-arch bridge connector saddle bar position corrected (`SADDLE_Y_FRACTION_LOWER` 0.28 → 0.19).

## [1.28.0] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- Position-aware surface notation: caries/filling surface letters and labels now read incisal/labial/palatal on the relevant tooth positions (occlusal → incisal on anteriors; buccal → labial on anteriors; lingual → palatal on upper teeth, lingual on lower teeth), controlled by a new Settings → Tooth details "Surface notation" setting (simple / full, default full). Applies to the whole-mouth summary and to both the caries and filling-defect surface pickers (letter + caption).
- A filling-defect hint note on the Fillings card (e.g. "36 has a filling defect recorded."), parallel to the existing subcaries hint note.
### Changed
- The filling-defect popup's option list now stacks vertically (previously horizontal), matching the caries-depth popup layout.
- Summary and surface-picker letters now default to the anatomically-specific ("full") notation instead of the generic B/O/L set.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-07-11
### Fixed
- Implants and missing/gap teeth once again offer their full restoration/attachment picker: crown/bridge + healing-abutment/locator/locator-denture/bar/bar-denture on an implant; bridge-pontic + removable-partial/removable-full on a missing/gap tooth.
- Restoration row is now hidden on a `radix` substrate tooth (no restoration can be authored on a root remnant).
- Mobility control is now hidden on implant teeth.
- Bridge teeth render both the crown cap AND the saddle connector (previously the connector only).
- Bridge overlay connectors are now arch-aware, fixing a lower-arch misalignment (mirrored saddle-Y geometry for the lower arch).
- Adding a bridge via a Statuses preset now triggers the overlay recompute, so the connector renders immediately instead of requiring a follow-up edit.
- The periapical-inflammation modifier toggle now shows only on missing/extraction-socket teeth (hidden on present teeth and on implants, where `apicalDx`/`periImplant` already drive the periapical/peri-implant glyph).
- Filling defects are now explicitly labeled in the whole-mouth Fillings summary line, matching how secondary caries is labeled on the Caries line.
### Added
- Settings → new "Panels" tab: independently toggle the Statuses and Orthodontics whole-mouth panel visibility.
- The Caries and Secondary-caries settings tabs are merged into one "Caries" tab, with the CARS (secondary-caries) control moved above Radiographic depth.
### Note
- The tooth SVG assets were refreshed alongside this release (unified front dimensions + occlusal ortho-bracket/ring, SVG version 2.5.0) — byte-identical render, no functional change.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- Per-tooth orthodontic charting: appliance (bracket/band), drift (mesial/distal), vertical movement (extrusion/intrusion), and rotation, reusing the dormant v2.5.0 ortho artwork (no new SVG). Shown on the chart, in the tooltip, and a new whole-mouth "Orthodontics" summary section.
### Migration
- Payload version 2.10 (imports 1.4–2.9 accepted). Additive — legacy charts carry no orthodontic findings.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-07-11
### Changed
- Tooth wear controls now sit on separate rows with the "Planned extraction" toggle below them (previously overflowed the panel).
### Added
- Settings → new "Tooth details" tab: a simple/complex detail level for tooth wear and for discoloration. Simple mode shows a yes/no toggle per finding (wear on → attrition/abrasion, discoloration on → other); complex mode (default) keeps the type/cause dropdowns. The stored value is preserved when switching levels.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- Tooth discoloration: record a discolored natural crown by cause (tetracycline, fluorosis, non-vital darkening, extrinsic staining, or other/unknown) on permanent and milk teeth. The chart tints the crown a representative colour; shown in the tooltip and a new whole-mouth "Discoloration" summary section. Completes the surface & structural conditions set (filling defect, wear, discoloration).
### Migration
- Payload version 2.9 (imports 1.4–2.8 accepted). Additive — legacy charts carry no discoloration.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-07-11
### Changed
- Tooth wear is now recorded by clinical type per location: an incisal/occlusal wear type (attrition / erosion) and a cervical wear type (abrasion / abfraction / erosion), replacing the two on/off wear flags. Shown in the tooltip and a new whole-mouth "Wear" summary section.
### Migration
- Payload version 2.8 (imports 1.4–2.7 accepted). A legacy edge-wear flag becomes attrition; a legacy cervical-wear flag becomes abrasion. The chart rendering is unchanged for migrated data.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- Per-surface filling defects for direct restorations: mark a filled surface as having a marginal defect, fracture/chip, or wear (independent of recurrent caries). Authored via a per-surface indicator on the Fillings card; shown in the tooltip and the whole-mouth summary; rendered on the chart.
### Migration
- Payload version 2.7 (imports 1.4–2.6 accepted). Additive — legacy charts carry no filling defects.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- The per-tooth tooltip and the whole-mouth summary panel now surface the full set of clinical findings added since v1.16: pulp diagnosis, apical diagnosis (+ lesion subtype), root resorption, peri-implant status, graded root caries, calculus, crown marginal leakage, fracture, contact loss, and bruxism wear. A new "Diagnoses" section groups the pulp/apical/resorption/peri-implant findings; caries carries a coarse severity qualifier (superficial/moderate/deep).

## [1.20.0] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- Peri-implant status axis for implants: peri-implant health / mucositis / peri-implantitis with graded (mild/moderate/severe) crestal bone loss, shown as a dedicated selector on implants.
### Changed
- Implants no longer render the (clinically incorrect) periapical lesion glyph; their inflammation is expressed through the new peri-implant axis. Missing/extraction-socket teeth are unaffected.
- Removed the ad-hoc "Peri-implantitis" relabel of the periodontal-modifier checkbox (superseded by the dedicated axis).
### Migration
- Payload version 2.6 (imports 1.4–2.5 accepted). On import, an implant that carried the inflammation or periodontal modifier becomes peri-implant mucositis (no bone-loss grade is invented).

## [1.19.0] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- **Merged Pulp/Endo status selector**: the endodontic-treatment (`endo`) and pulp-diagnosis (`pulpDx`) pickers are now one control; a root-treated tooth (`endo != none`) no longer carries a vital pulp diagnosis — the two fields are mutually exclusive, and on such a tooth `pulpDx` is normalized to `normal` with the diseased-pulp glyph suppressed.
- **Merged "Root and periodontium" card**: the separate "Root" and "Periodontium and inflammations" panels are consolidated into a single card.
- **Periapical lesion subtype reduced to granuloma/cyst**: the redundant "abscess" subtype is dropped (it is already covered by the apical diagnosis); the subtype selector (`none` / `granuloma` / `cyst`) is now shown only under symptomatic or asymptomatic apical periodontitis.
- **Reversible pulpitis** now renders a reduced pulp glyph.
- **Retired the duplicate "periapical inflammation" toggle** on present teeth; the apical diagnosis alone drives the periapical glyph.

### Migration
- JSON/FHIR export payload version bumped to **2.5**; imports still accept legacy 1.4–2.4 payloads and migrate them automatically. On import, a treated tooth's pulp diagnosis is normalized to `normal`, and a legacy `abscess` periapical-lesion subtype is dropped — folded into the apical diagnosis when the tooth carries the inflammation modifier, otherwise cleared, since the apical diagnosis already covers abscess.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **CARS 0–6 score names**: the secondary-caries picker now shows descriptive ICDAS-based names (Sound, First visual change in enamel, Distinct visual change in enamel, Localized enamel breakdown, Underlying dentin shadow, Distinct cavity, Extensive cavity) instead of raw numbers.
- **Root-caries severity opacity**: the `caries-root` artwork layer now renders at an opacity driven by `rootCaries` (`active` 0.5 / `arrested` 0.7 / `active-cavitated` full), instead of a flat opacity regardless of severity.
- **Fillings-panel subcaries summary line**: a line below the filling controls lists any selected tooth with recurrent (subcaries) caries and its surfaces, e.g. "36 (O) has subcaries set on its filling."
- **Anterior "incisal" surface label**: incisors and canines now label their occlusal surface "incisal" throughout the UI (picker, popup, summaries/tooltips); the stored surface key is unchanged (`occlusal`).
- **Contextual per-surface caries popup**: the surface-depth popup now shows only the severity group relevant to the surface's current state (the primary ICDAS-depth group on an unfilled surface, the CARS group on a filled one), instead of always showing both.

### Changed
- **Unified caries severity field**: the separate SP5 ICDAS-depth (`cariesDepths`) and CARS (`secondaryCaries`) fields are replaced by a single per-surface `cariesSeverity` (0–6), read as ICDAS depth on a primary (unfilled) surface and as a CARS score on a recurrent (filled) one. JSON/FHIR export payload version bumped to **2.4**; imports still accept legacy 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 payloads and migrate them automatically.

### Fixed
- **Caries/subcaries is now a proper per-surface state machine**: recurrent caries renders the `subcaries-{surface}` layer at the surface's CARS severity and is no longer settable alongside primary caries on the same surface — a surface is always exactly one of primary caries, recurrent (subcaries), or sound, eliminating the previous ambiguity where both a `caries-{surface}` and a derived recurrent state could coexist.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Root caries** clinical axis (`rootCaries`): none / active / arrested / active-cavitated — wires the previously dormant `caries-root` artwork layer on a present tooth's main-view templates.
- **Stored secondary (recurrent) caries score** (`secondaryCaries`): a per-surface CARS 0–6 score, rendered as the `subcaries-{surface}` layer's opacity (`0.30 + (score-1)/5 × 0.70`) — replaces the old render-time derivation from `caries ∩ fillingSurfaceMaterials`.
- **Radiographic caries depth** (`radiographicDepth`): a per-surface none / E1 / E2 / D1 / D2 / D3 finding, independent of the visual ICDAS depth scale — surfaced as a `data-radio` badge attribute on the surface indicator, and round-trips through FHIR via its own `radiographic-caries-depth` Observation.
- **Three caries granularity settings** (`secondaryCariesMode`, `rootCariesMode`, `radiographicDepthMode`) plus `cariesDepthEnabled`, letting the picker UI collapse each scale to a simpler view without losing the underlying stored value.
- **Tabbed Settings modal** (General / Caries / Secondary caries / Pulpa / Notes), replacing the previous flat settings dropdown.

### Changed
- JSON export payload bumped to **version 2.3**; imports still accept legacy 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 payloads and migrate them automatically (a migrated `caries ∩ fillingSurfaceMaterials` surface is promoted to the canonical "moderate" `secondaryCaries` score of 3, unless a stored score is already present).
- Secondary (recurrent) caries is now a **stored, scored** clinical finding (`secondaryCaries`), not derived at render/summary time from `caries ∩ fillingSurfaceMaterials`.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **AAE pulp diagnosis** clinical axis (`pulpDx`): normal / reversible pulpitis / irreversible pulpitis / necrosis — replaces the retired `pulpInflam` boolean, with a byte-identical SVG render for the migrated "inflamed pulp" case (on both permanent and milk-tooth branches).
- **Practical-Latin pulp subtypes** (`pulpLatin`): pulpa sana, hyperaemia pulpae, pulpitis acuta serosa/purulenta, pulpitis chronica clausa/ulcerosa/hyperplastica, necrosis pulpae, gangraena pulpae — surfaced through a new 3-level **pulp detail setting** (`pulpDetailLevel`: `simple` / `aae` / `latin`, default `aae`) that collapses the pulp picker to the appropriate vocabulary; `getPulpDetailLevel()`/`setPulpDetailLevel()` public API.
- **Apical diagnosis** clinical axis (`apicalDx`): normal / symptomatic apical periodontitis / asymptomatic apical periodontitis / acute apical abscess / chronic apical abscess / condensing osteitis — now drives the periapical glyph directly on a present tooth.
- **Root resorption type** (`resorptionType`): internal / external-cervical — replaces the retired `rootResorption` boolean, with a byte-identical SVG render (including the `inflammationHome` z-order lift when combined with an apical diagnosis).

### Changed
- JSON export payload bumped to **version 2.2**; imports still accept legacy 1.4, 2.0, and 2.1 payloads and migrate them automatically (`pulpInflam` → `pulpDx`, `rootResorption` → `resorptionType`, `mods.inflammation`/`periapicalType` → `apicalDx`).
- The periapical glyph is now driven by the `apicalDx` diagnosis axis, decoupled from the `mods.inflammation` modifier (existing `mods.inflammation` payloads still migrate to an equivalent `apicalDx` value; render is byte-identical for migrated states).
- The legacy `pulpInflam` and `rootResorption` boolean clinical axes are retired from the live state model (kept only as a read-only input-side migration path for legacy payloads).

## [1.15.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- New **`prosthesis`** clinical axis (healing-abutment / locator / locator-denture / bar / bar-denture / removable-partial / removable-full), orthogonal to `restorationType`×`restorationMaterial`, surfaced with a "Kivehető:" prefix in the combined restoration dropdown. Covers implant attachments (healing abutment, locator, bar, with or without an overdenture) and tooth-supported removable partial/full dentures — replacing the legacy `crownMaterial`/`bridgeUnit` attachment and removable values field-for-field (byte-identical render).
- **Implant fixed crowns** now join the `restorationType`×`restorationMaterial` model: implants are no longer gated away from crown/bridge restoration options, and render via composition (`{material}-{type}` layers) plus an implant connector layer, with `metal` migrating to `metal-ceramic` for implants too.
- Multi-tooth **bridge-span overlay**: consecutive bridge teeth (`restorationType: "bridge"` or `bridgePillar`) within one arch now render a single continuous gum-line saddle across the inter-tooth gaps, drawn as an engine-owned `<svg>` over the tooth grid. The overlay is purely presentational (derives spans from existing tooth state; no new state field), repositions on resize, and is included in SVG/PNG/JPG export.
- **Crown marginal-leakage toggle**: a new `crownLeakage` boolean clinical axis + tooth-editor checkbox, shown only for a crown or bridge restoration, activating the previously dormant `crown-leakage` artwork layer. Round-trips through FHIR export/import (`crown-leakage` finding) like any other boolean axis.

### Changed
- JSON export payload bumped to **version 2.1** (adds `prosthesis`, drops `crownMaterial`/`bridgeUnit`); imports still accept legacy 1.4 and 2.0 payloads and migrate them automatically (implant `crownMaterial` fixed crowns → `restorationType`+material; attachment/removable `crownMaterial`/`bridgeUnit` values → `prosthesis`).
- FHIR export now emits a `prosthesis` coding in place of the dropped attachment/removable `crown-material`/`bridge-unit` codings, restoring round-trip fidelity for implant attachments (locator/bar/healing-abutment) that SP3a had dropped from FHIR; implant crowns round-trip via the existing `restoration-type`/`restoration-material` codings.
- The legacy `crownMaterial`/`bridgeUnit` fields are fully retired from state, serialization, and the value-map registry (kept only as a read-only input-side migration path for legacy payloads).

### Fixed
- **Invalid restoration type/material combinations are now corrected on import**: a hand-edited or imported payload that pairs a restoration type with a material it doesn't support (e.g. an inlay in metal) is coerced to that type's first valid material (or dropped to no restoration if the type itself carries none), and a warning is surfaced — instead of silently persisting a combination the renderer would have drawn nothing for.
- **Implant fixed crowns from 2.0-format payloads are no longer silently dropped on import**: an implant crown serialized by an intermediate build as `{restorationType:"none", crownMaterial:<material>}` now correctly folds into `restorationType:"crown"` + that material (with `metal` → `metal-ceramic`), instead of vanishing.
- The combined restoration dropdown now actually lists the **"Kivehető:" (removable) `prosthesis` entries** (implant attachments for an implant tooth; removable partial/full dentures for a gap) and writes the `prosthesis` axis when one is chosen — previously only the "Fix:" half was wired and the removable prefix was unused.
- Selecting a "Kivehető:" prosthesis or a fixed restoration now keeps the two axes mutually exclusive (a tooth has **either** a fixed restoration **or** a prosthesis); import also enforces this coherence (restoration wins if a crafted payload sets both).
- **Stale `crownLeakage` is now cleared** when a restoration changes away from crown/bridge, preventing an orphaned `crown-leakage` finding on a non-crown tooth.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Two-dimensional restoration model: `restorationType` (crown/inlay/onlay/veneer/bridge) × `restorationMaterial` (e.max/gold/gradia/zirconia/metal/metal-ceramic/telescope/temporary), replacing the flat `crownMaterial` enum as the clinical axis.
- New `toothSubstrate` axis (natural/radix/broken/crownprep) describing the tooth's underlying structure, independent of any restoration placed on it.
- Gold, Gradia, and metal-ceramic (PFM) restoration materials, and inlay/onlay/veneer restoration types, wired from the previously dormant v2.5 artwork into charting.
- Combined, low-click restoration dropdown (type × material in a single control) in the tooth editor.
- Groundwork for crown-marginal-leakage findings (new axis values only; UI is not wired yet — deferred to a later stage).

### Changed
- Legacy `metal` crowns and bridges now migrate to `metal-ceramic` (PFM) on load; the pre-existing full-cast look is now the distinct `metal` restoration material.
- JSON export payload bumped to **version 2.0**; imports still accept legacy 1.4 payloads and migrate them automatically.
- FHIR export now emits `restoration-type` / `restoration-material` / `tooth-substrate` codings in place of the old `crown-material` coding.

### Removed
- The flat `crownMaterial` enum as a clinical axis (a legacy field of the same name is retained internally only to drive implant-attachment rendering, per the migration plan).

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Internal architecture: FHIR export/import, value validation, SVG clear-set + boolean-flag layer activation, and the stable UI option lists are now generated from a single declarative clinical-axis registry (`src/registry/`) instead of scattered ad-hoc maps. Behavior-preserving — the JSON payload (version 1.4) and FHIR output are byte-identical to 1.12.0, guarded by frozen parity goldens.

### Removed
- Dead code orphaned by the registry migration (unused SVG-group helpers, duplicated dependency literals, superseded `GROUPS` layer lists).

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Updated tooth SVG assets to artwork version 2.5.0 (new dental-material, orthodontic, planning, root-fracture, filling-defect and root-caries layers added as dormant layers; not yet wired into charting — see the architecture-constitution spec).

### Fixed
- Corrected the `inicisal` → `incisal` broken-crown layer-id typo across the engine and SVG assets.
- Fixed the `prosthesis-bridge-connector` → `prosthesis-connector` id in `16_occl.svg` so the removable-prosthesis connector renders in the occlusal view.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-07-10

Documentation accuracy and FHIR value-map consistency.

### Fixed
- Corrected the HL7 FHIR export claim in every README language variant (including
  the new pt-BR) and the CHANGELOG: the export emits local + ISO 3950 (permanent
  dentition) codings — SNOMED CT is not yet emitted (mapping planned). Aligned the
  `src/fhir/codesystems.ts` comments accordingly.

### Changed
- FHIR export: added the `crownprep` ("Prepared for crown") crown material to the
  local value map so it exports with a proper display; removed the obsolete
  `tooth-crownprep` tooth-selection value (it is now a crown material, not a base type).
- Extended the FHIR value-map test to cover `periapicalType`.
- `package.json` — version 1.11.0 → 1.11.1.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-07-10

Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) UI language.

### Added
- **Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-br`)** as a 9th UI language: full translation of every i18n key in `src/i18n/translations.ts`, added to the topbar language switcher (`LANGUAGE_OPTIONS` in `src/App.tsx`) and to the `Language` type. Localized `language.pt-br` display name added to all existing languages.
- New `lang/README-pt-br.md` (translated from the English README); the 🇧🇷 Português (BR) entry added to every README language switcher.

### Changed
- `package.json` — version 1.10.0 → 1.11.0.
- README language lists and API docs updated from `HU/EN/DE/ES/IT/SK/PL/RU` to include `PT-BR` across all languages.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-03

Tooth-information panel, dynamic subtitle, crown-prep type, SVG/z-order fixes, and a multilingual README overhaul.

### Added
- **Tooth information panel** — live textual summary of the whole chart: tooth counts, present/missing lists, and Caries (incl. secondary) / Fillings / Root canals / Prosthetics / Implants (only when present) / periodontal status. Shown by default; toggleable in the Settings menu. Plural-aware phrasing per language; refreshes live.
- New public API: `getOdontogramSummary()` (structured, localized summary) and `onStateChange(callback)` (subscribe to state changes; returns an unsubscribe function).
- Dynamic topbar subtitle reflecting the current language, numbering system, and light/dark mode.
- `crownprep` ("Prepared for crown") as a permanent-tooth crown material — moved from the Base dropdown into the Crown dropdown; mirrors the "broken" crown behavior and renders the crown-prep layer. Crown list reordered with `radix` first; default stays `natural` (Full crown).
- Standalone per-language README files under `lang/` (de, hu, it, sk, pl, ru); `README.md` keeps English + Spanish with a language switcher.
- ~40 new i18n keys × 8 languages (tooth-info panel, dynamic subtitle, implants, crown-prep label reuse).

### Changed
- Renamed the app to **React Odontogram Modul** (from "…Editor Modul") across all languages.
- Re-normalized the tooth 14 SVG to the current layer format (typed periapical glyphs, calculus, subcaries, resorption, fissure sealing).
- Refined the Hungarian endodontic wording to precise clinical terms.
- CHANGELOG brought up to date (1.5.0–1.10.0); README rigorously reviewed to match current behavior.
- `package.json` — version 1.9.0 → 1.10.0.

### Fixed
- Global visibility toggles (wisdom/occlusal/bone/pulp/edentulous) and card collapse now use delegated listeners, so they survive React StrictMode's double mount instead of cancelling themselves out — this also restored the periodontal/periapical inflammation buttons.
- Inflammation glyph z-order: when `endo-resection` and/or `endo-resorption` is active together with an inflammation glyph, the inflammation group is lifted above the tooth group (keeping the lower-tooth mirror transform) so the glyph stays visible.
- Calculus row spacing in its default state; no tooth-base gloss on broken/radix crowns.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-01

Unified topbar icon row and optional ICDAS II caries scoring.

### Added
- Unified topbar icon row with a Settings menu (numbering, notes, ICDAS, tooth information).
- Optional **ICDAS II** per-surface caries scoring (0–6) via the `enableIcdas` prop / Settings toggle, with a numeric badge on scored surfaces; included in FHIR export.

### Changed
- Consolidated the topbar controls (intro, language, dark mode, settings, export, import) into a single icon row.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-30

Clinical marking layers, native SVG export, and per-surface caries depth.

### Added
- Clinical marking layers (v2.1.4 tooth SVGs): calculus, root resorption, secondary (recurrent) caries, and typed periapical lesions (granuloma / cyst / abscess).
- Per-surface caries depth (superficial / dentin / deep) with a depth selector and popup.
- Native SVG export of the chart; PNG/JPG now rasterize from the vector SVG.

### Fixed
- Lesion type options and filling cross size; clearer note icon; persistent note icon after tooth-number refresh; calculus toggle id collision.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-23

Export/Import dropdowns, FHIR import, progress overlay, intro tour, and periapical lesion types.

### Added
- Consolidated Export dropdown (Status JSON / FHIR / PNG / JPG) and an Import dropdown with status/FHIR routing.
- HL7 FHIR R4 import — parse self-produced FHIR Bundles back into chart state (round-trip).
- Phased progress overlay during image export.
- 12-step interactive intro tour.
- Periapical lesion entity type (granuloma / cyst / abscess).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-20

Cross-surface selection UI, mixed fillings, and PNG/JPG export.

### Added
- Cross/plus surface selection UI (B/M/O/D/L) for caries and fillings.
- Per-surface restoration materials (mixed fillings, e.g. buccal amalgam + distal composite); JSON schema 1.4 + FHIR support.
- Engine PNG/JPG export of the odontogram.

### Fixed
- Molar filters now include all molars; hide `tooth-base-beauty` gloss on implants.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-14

HL7 FHIR R4 export, MIT license, and English default language.
