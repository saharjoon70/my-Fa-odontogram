### 📋 Overview

[`vue-advanced-odontogram`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-advanced-odontogram) is the **Vue 3 edition** of [React Odontogram Modul](https://github.com/ZoliQua/React-Odontogram-Modul) — the same interactive dental chart editor, reimplemented as a standalone Vue library you can install from npm.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Upstream (React)** | [ZoliQua/React-Odontogram-Modul](https://github.com/ZoliQua/React-Odontogram-Modul) — original React 18 editor |
| **This package (Vue)** | `vue-advanced-odontogram` — Vue 3.5 + TypeScript, SFC shell (`OdontogramShell`) |
| **Shared behavior** | JSON/FHIR payloads, SVG tooth templates, clinical state model, and chart rendering stay compatible with the React editor (payload version 2.10) |

Install it in any Vue 3 app, import the bundled styles, and embed `OdontogramShell` like any other component. The imperative odontogram engine (tooth state, FHIR export, plugins) is unchanged from the React lineage; only the UI shell was rewritten for Vue.

It renders layered SVG tooth templates to represent restorations, caries, endodontic status, mobility, and other clinical details, while providing multi-select, selection filters, and predefined status presets.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🖱️ Fast selection and multi-select (CMD/CTRL + click)
- 🦷 Tooth types: permanent, primary (milk), implant, subgingival, missing
- 🦷 Tooth substrate (orthogonal to any restoration): natural, radix (root remnant), broken, prepared for crown
- 👑 Restorations by type × material: crown / inlay / onlay / veneer / bridge in e.max, gold, gradia, zirconia, metal, metal-ceramic, telescope or temporary (onlay is occlusal-view only) — chosen from one combined low-click "Fix: Crown – …" picker; legacy `metal` crowns migrate to `metal-ceramic` (PFM); implants use the same type × material model, composed with an implant connector layer. The picker is scoped by tooth kind: an implant offers only crown/bridge (plus its five attachment options, below); a missing/gap tooth offers only a bridge pontic (plus removable-partial/-full); a `radix` substrate hides the restoration control entirely (no restoration can be authored on a root remnant)
- 🦿 Removable/attachment prosthetics on the dedicated `prosthesis` axis ("Kivehető:" entries in the combined picker): implant healing abutment, locator, locator with overdenture, bar, bar with overdenture; tooth-supported removable partial or full denture
- 🌉 Bridge teeth render both the crown cap and the saddle connector; a multi-tooth bridge-span overlay renders one continuous, arch-aware connector across consecutive bridge teeth (pontics + abutments) and the inter-tooth gaps between them (upper vs. lower arch use mirrored saddle geometry, keeping the connector aligned on both arches), included in PNG/JPG/SVG export; applying a bridge via a Statuses preset recomputes the overlay immediately
- 🔍 Caries charting on 6 surfaces: mesial, distal, buccal, lingual, occlusal, subcrown
- 🪥 Filling materials per surface: amalgam, composite, GIC, temporary
- 🏥 One merged "Pulp / Endo status" selector (grouped: vital pulp vs. treated/endo): endodontic states (medicinal filling, root canal filling, incomplete root filling, glass fiber post, metal post) and AAE pulp diagnosis (`pulpDx`: normal / reversible / irreversible pulpitis / necrosis) are mutually exclusive — a root-treated tooth (`endo` set) cannot also carry a vital pulp diagnosis; on treatment, `pulpDx` is normalized to `normal` and the diseased-pulp glyph is suppressed. Reversible pulpitis renders a reduced pulp glyph. An optional 3-level pulp detail setting (`pulpDetailLevel`: simple / AAE / practical-Latin) surfaces 9 practical-Latin pulp subtypes (pulpa sana … gangraena pulpae) via `pulpLatin`; resection and parapulpal pin remain separate special indicators
- 🦴 Apical diagnosis (`apicalDx`: symptomatic/asymptomatic apical periodontitis, acute/chronic apical abscess, condensing osteitis) drives the periapical glyph directly; a granuloma/cyst lesion-subtype qualifier is shown only under symptomatic/asymptomatic apical periodontitis (the redundant "abscess" subtype was dropped — it's already covered by the apical diagnosis)
- 🩹 Merged "Root and periodontium" card (single collapsible section for root/periapical and periodontal findings)
- ⚕️ Modifications: periapical inflammation (shown only on missing/extraction-socket teeth; hidden on present teeth, where `apicalDx` alone drives the periapical glyph, and on implants, where `periImplant` covers it), periodontal disease, mobility grades (M1/M2/M3, hidden on implants)
- 🦷🔩 Peri-implant status (`periImplant`: none / mucositis / peri-implantitis-mild / -moderate / -severe) — 2018 World Workshop staging, shown as a dedicated selector on implants; mucositis reuses the periodontal gum glyph, peri-implantitis adds a graded `peri-implant-bone-loss` layer (opacity 0.4/0.7/1.0). Implants no longer render the periapical lesion glyph — their inflammation is expressed through this axis instead — and the periodontal-modifier checkboxes are hidden on implants (the ad-hoc "Peri-implantitis" checkbox relabel is retired)
- 🏷️ Special indicators: crown needed, crown replacement needed, missing closed gap, extraction plan, fissure sealing, contact point loss
- 👁️ Occlusal view, wisdom teeth, bone and pulp visibility toggles
- 🔢 12 selection filters (all, present, permanent, milk, implants, missing, upper/lower, front/molars)
- 📊 Predefined status presets (reset, primary dentition, mixed dentition, edentulous)
- 📦 34 predefined restoration templates (bridges, removable dentures, bar dentures with implants)
- 💾 Status export/import in JSON (version 2.10; imports still accept legacy 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 and migrate automatically, with plugin custom states and per-tooth notes)
- 🔗 HL7 FHIR R4 export (collection Bundle of per-tooth Observations, ISO 3950 tooth coding for permanent dentition, local code system — SNOMED CT mapping planned)
- ✚ Cross/plus surface selection UI (B/M/O/D/L) for caries and fillings
- 🧱 Per-surface restoration materials (mixed fillings, e.g. buccal amalgam + distal composite)
- 🖼️ PNG/JPG/SVG image export of the chart (downloadable; PNG/JPG rasterized from vector SVG)
- 🦷 Caries/subcaries is a per-surface state machine: a caried surface with no filling renders as primary caries (ICDAS-tiered opacity); once a filling is present on that surface it renders as recurrent caries instead (the `subcaries-{surface}` layer, CARS-scored) — the two are never both active on the same surface
- 🎯 Unified per-surface severity (`cariesSeverity`, 0–6, replacing the old separate ICDAS-depth + CARS fields): read as ICDAS depth on a primary surface, as a named CARS score (Sound … Extensive cavity) on a recurrent one, via a contextual popup that shows only the scale relevant to the surface's current state
- 🌱 Root caries (`rootCaries`: none / active / arrested / active-cavitated), wiring the dedicated root-caries artwork layer at a severity-driven opacity (active 0.5 / arrested 0.7 / active-cavitated full)
- 📡 Radiographic caries depth (`radiographicDepth`: none / E1 / E2 / D1 / D2 / D3 per surface), independent of the visual ICDAS/CARS severity scale, surfaced as a badge and round-tripped through its own FHIR Observation
- 🎚️ Three caries granularity settings (`secondaryCariesMode`, `rootCariesMode`, `radiographicDepthMode`) plus a `cariesDepthEnabled` toggle, collapsing each scale to a simpler picker view without losing the stored value
- 🩹 Fillings-panel subcaries summary line: lists any selected tooth with recurrent caries and its surfaces below the filling controls (e.g. "36 (O) has subcaries set on its filling.")
- 🪛 Per-surface filling defects (`fillingDefect`: none / marginal / fracture / wear) on direct restorations, independent of recurrent caries — authored via a per-surface indicator on the Fillings card (mirroring the caries-depth indicator, its option list stacked vertically), rendered on the chart, and shown in the tooltip and the whole-mouth fillings summary with an explicit label (e.g. "36 (O) – Filling defect: O: marginal"), the same way recurrent caries is labeled on the Caries line; the Fillings card also shows a hint note for any selected tooth with a recorded filling defect (e.g. "36 has a filling defect recorded."), parallel to the existing subcaries hint note
- 🦷💥 Tooth wear typed by clinical cause and location (`wearEdge`: none / attrition / erosion, incisal/occlusal; `wearCervical`: none / abrasion / abfraction / erosion, cervical) — replacing the two on/off bruxism-wear flags; authored via two dropdowns on the wear row, reuses the existing wear artwork, and shown in the tooltip and a new whole-mouth "Wear" summary section
- 🎨 Tooth discoloration by cause (`discoloration`: none / tetracycline / fluorosis / nonvital / extrinsic / other) on permanent and milk teeth — tints the shown natural crown a representative colour when the tooth has no restoration and natural substrate; shown in the tooltip and a new whole-mouth "Discoloration" summary section; completes the surface & structural conditions set alongside filling defects and wear
- ✏️ Anterior teeth (incisors/canines) label their occlusal surface "incisal" throughout the UI (picker, popup, summaries); the stored surface key stays `occlusal`
- 🔤 Position-aware surface notation (Settings → Tooth details → "Surface notation", simple/full, default full): in full mode the caries/filling surface letter and label follow tooth anatomy — occlusal → I/incisal on anterior teeth, buccal → L/labial on anterior teeth, lingual → P/palatal on upper teeth and L/lingual on lower teeth (mesial/distal/subcrown are unaffected); simple mode always uses the generic B/M/O/D/L/SC set regardless of tooth position. Applies to the whole-mouth summary and to both the caries and filling-defect surface pickers (letter + caption); the stored surface key is unaffected
- 🦷↕️ Per-tooth orthodontic charting (`orthoAppliance`: none / bracket / band; `orthoDrift`: none / mesial / distal; `orthoVertical`: none / extrusion / intrusion; `orthoRotation`: boolean) on a present natural tooth (permanent or milk) — reuses the dormant v2.5.0 ortho artwork (no new SVG); shown on the chart, in the tooltip, and a new whole-mouth "Orthodontics" summary section
- 🪨 Calculus, and root resorption typed as internal or external-cervical (`resorptionType`)
- 📏 Per-surface caries depth (superficial / dentin / deep), or optional ICDAS II scoring (0–6) via `enableIcdas`
- 🩹 Crown marginal-leakage toggle, shown only for a crown or bridge restoration
- 🧰 Unified topbar icon row with a tabbed Settings modal (General / Panels / Tooth details / Caries / Pulpa / Notes — numbering, notes, panel visibility, ICDAS, caries-depth toggle, root/radiographic caries granularity, pulp detail level, tooth wear/discoloration detail level, tooth information)
- 🗂️ Settings → "Panels" tab: independently show/hide the Statuses and Orthodontics whole-mouth summary panels
- 🩹 Secondary-caries (CARS) settings control merged into the Caries settings tab, positioned above Radiographic depth (the separate "Secondary caries" tab is retired)
- 🎚️ Tooth details detail level (Settings → Tooth details): a simple/complex setting for tooth wear and for discoloration. Simple mode shows a yes/no toggle per finding (wear on → attrition/abrasion, discoloration on → other); complex mode (default) keeps the type/cause dropdowns, and the stored value is preserved when switching levels
- 📋 Tooth information panel: live text summary of the whole chart (tooth counts, present/missing lists, caries incl. secondary, fillings, root canals, prosthetics, implants, periodontal status) — shown by default, toggleable in Settings
- 🗂️ Consolidated Export dropdown (Status JSON / FHIR / PNG / JPG)
- 📥 Import dropdown with FHIR import (round-trips exported Bundles)
- ⏳ Progress overlay during image export
- 🎓 12-step interactive intro tour
- 🔢 Three numbering systems (FDI, Universal, Palmer)

- ⚠️ State validation warnings for incompatible tooth state combinations
- 🏷️ Automatic state tooltip on tooth tiles (shows all active states)
- 🩺 Modernized per-tooth tooltip and whole-mouth summary panel: both surface the full set of clinical findings (pulp/apical diagnosis + lesion subtype, root resorption, peri-implant status, graded root caries, calculus, crown marginal leakage, fracture, contact loss, typed edge/cervical wear), with a dedicated "Diagnoses" section in the panel, a dedicated "Wear" section, and a coarse caries-severity qualifier (superficial/moderate/deep)
- ♿ Keyboard accessibility (WCAG): ARIA listbox/option roles, Enter/Space selection, arrow key navigation, focus-visible outlines
- 🔒 Read-only mode: disable all interactions for print/report/view use cases
- ✨ Selection animations: pulsing dashed border and glowing drop-shadow on selected teeth (with prefers-reduced-motion support)
- 📝 Per-tooth notes: double-click to add/edit notes, note icon next to tooth number, hover tooltip with note text, JSON export/import

### 🦷 Tooth Types and States

**Tooth selection (base type):**
| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `none` | Missing tooth |
| `tooth-base` | Permanent tooth |
| `milktooth` | Primary (deciduous) tooth |
| `implant` | Dental implant |
| `tooth-under-gum` | Subgingival (unerupted) tooth |

**Broken tooth variants:**
`tooth-broken-inicisal`, `tooth-broken-distal-inicisal`, `tooth-broken-distal`, `tooth-broken-mesial-distal-inicisal`, `tooth-broken-mesial-distal`, `tooth-broken-mesial-inicisal`, `tooth-broken-mesial`, `no-tooth-after-extraction`

**Tooth substrate (permanent teeth):**
`natural` (default), `radix` (root remnant), `broken`, `crownprep` (prepared for crown)

**Restoration type (permanent teeth):**
`none`, `crown`, `inlay`, `onlay` (occlusal view only), `veneer`, `bridge`

**Restoration material (permanent teeth):**
`none`, `emax`, `gold`, `gradia`, `zircon`, `metal`, `metal-ceramic` (legacy `metal` crowns migrate here), `telescope`, `temporary`

**Restoration options are gated by tooth kind** (`restorationOptions()` in `src/registry/restorations.ts`): an implant offers only `crown`/`bridge` restoration types (composed with an implant connector layer) plus the five `prosthesis` attachment entries below; a missing/gap tooth offers only a `bridge` pontic plus the two removable-denture `prosthesis` entries; a `radix` substrate hides the restoration control entirely. The legacy flat `crownMaterial`/`bridgeUnit` fields (pre-v1.14 implant/bridge attachment values) are retired from the live model — only accepted as a read-only migration path for old payloads.

**Prosthesis** (`prosthesis`; orthogonal removable/attachment axis, surfaced as "Kivehető:" entries in the combined restoration dropdown):
`none`, `healing-abutment`, `locator`, `locator-denture`, `bar`, `bar-denture` (implant attachments, with or without an overdenture), `removable-partial`, `removable-full` (tooth-supported dentures on a missing/gap tooth). A tooth has either a fixed restoration or a prosthesis, never both — setting one clears the other.

**Crown marginal leakage** (`crownLeakage`; boolean): shown only when `restorationType` is `crown` or `bridge`; activates the `crown-leakage` artwork layer.

**Endodontic options (permanent teeth):**
`none`, `endo-medical-filling`, `endo-filling`, `endo-filling-incomplete`, `endo-glass-pin`, `endo-metal-pin`

**Endodontic options (milk teeth):**
`none`, `endo-medical-filling`

`endo` and `pulpDx` are surfaced through one merged "Pulp / Endo status" `<select>` (grouped: vital pulp vs. treated/endo) and are mutually exclusive — choosing a treated (`endo != none`) option resets `pulpDx` to `normal` and choosing a pulp diagnosis resets `endo` to `none`.

**Filling materials (permanent teeth):**
`amalgam`, `composite`, `gic`, `temporary`

**Filling materials (milk teeth):**
`composite`, `gic`, `temporary`

**Filling/caries surfaces:**
`mesial`, `distal`, `buccal`, `lingual`, `occlusal`, `subcrown` (caries only)

**Modifications:**
`inflammation` (periapical), `parodontal` (periodontal), `mobility` (M1/M2/M3)

**Periapical lesion type** (`periapicalType`; qualifies the periapical glyph, shown only under symptomatic/asymptomatic apical periodontitis):
`none`, `granuloma`, `cyst` — authoring options; the legacy `abscess` value is still accepted/stored but no longer offered in the picker, since it duplicates the apical diagnosis. On import it is dropped: folded into `apicalDx` when the tooth carries the inflammation modifier, otherwise cleared to `none`

**Pulp diagnosis** (AAE terminology; `pulpDx`):
`normal`, `reversible-pulpitis` (renders a reduced pulp glyph), `irreversible-pulpitis`, `necrosis` — mutually exclusive with `endo`; normalized to `normal` on a root-treated tooth

**Pulp diagnosis, practical Latin** (`pulpLatin`; shown by the pulp picker only when `pulpDetailLevel` is `latin`):
`none`, `pulpa-sana`, `hyperaemia-pulpae`, `pulpitis-acuta-serosa`, `pulpitis-acuta-purulenta`, `pulpitis-chronica-clausa`, `pulpitis-chronica-ulcerosa`, `pulpitis-chronica-hyperplastica`, `necrosis-pulpae`, `gangraena-pulpae`

**Pulp detail level** (`pulpDetailLevel`, global setting): `simple`, `aae` (default), `latin` — controls which pulp vocabulary the picker offers

**Apical diagnosis** (`apicalDx`; drives the periapical glyph):
`normal`, `symptomatic-apical-periodontitis`, `asymptomatic-apical-periodontitis`, `acute-apical-abscess`, `chronic-apical-abscess`, `condensing-osteitis`

**Root resorption type** (`resorptionType`):
`none`, `internal`, `external-cervical`

**Peri-implant status** (`periImplant`; implant-only, 2018 World Workshop staging): `mucositis` reuses the periodontal gum glyph; `peri-implantitis-*` adds the `peri-implant-bone-loss` layer at severity-scaled opacity (mild 0.4 / moderate 0.7 / severe 1.0). Implants no longer render the periapical lesion glyph (their inflammation is expressed via this axis instead), and the `mods` inflammation/parodontal checkboxes are hidden on implants:
`none`, `mucositis`, `peri-implantitis-mild`, `peri-implantitis-moderate`, `peri-implantitis-severe`

**Caries severity** (`cariesSeverity`; unified per-surface field, `0`–`6`): on a surface with no filling it is read as the ICDAS caries-depth scale (`superficial` / `dentin` / `deep`, or the raw ICDAS II codes `0–6` when `enableIcdas` is set) and renders the primary `caries-{surface}` layer; on a surface with a filling it is read as a named CARS score (`0` sound … `6` extensive cavity) and renders the `subcaries-{surface}` (recurrent-caries) layer instead — a surface is never both primary and recurrent at once

**Root caries** (`rootCaries`; wires the `caries-root` artwork layer on a present tooth, opacity driven by severity — `active` 0.5 / `arrested` 0.7 / `active-cavitated` full):
`none`, `active`, `arrested`, `active-cavitated`

**Radiographic caries depth** (`radiographicDepth`; per surface, independent of the visual ICDAS/CARS `cariesSeverity` scale):
`none`, `E1`, `E2`, `D1`, `D2`, `D3`

**Caries granularity settings** (global): `secondaryCariesMode` (`simple`/`standard`/`full`, default `standard`), `rootCariesMode` (`simple`/`severity`, default `simple`), `radiographicDepthMode` (`off`/`threeLevel`/`detailed`, default `off`), `cariesDepthEnabled` (boolean, default `true`) — each collapses its scale to a simpler picker view without altering the stored value

**Special indicators:**
`crownNeeded`, `crownReplace`, `missingClosed`, `extractionPlan`, `extractionWound`, `bridgePillar`, `fissureSealing`, `contactMesial`, `contactDistal`, `endoResection`, `calculus`, `parapulpalPin`

**Tooth wear** (`wearEdge`, `wearCervical`; per-location clinical type, gated on tooth-base + no restoration + natural substrate; render the existing `tooth-bruxism-wear`/`tooth-bruxism-neck-wear` layers):
`wearEdge`: `none`, `attrition`, `erosion` — `wearCervical`: `none`, `abrasion`, `abfraction`, `erosion`

**Discoloration** (`discoloration`; per-tooth cause, gated on a natural tooth-base or milk tooth + no restoration + natural substrate; tints the shown natural crown's fill — no new SVG):
`none`, `tetracycline`, `fluorosis`, `nonvital`, `extrinsic`, `other`

**Filling defect** (`fillingDefect`; per surface, direct-restoration finding independent of recurrent caries — gated to surfaces present in `fillingSurfaceMaterials`; renders the `defect-{surface}` artwork layer):
`none`, `marginal`, `fracture`, `wear`

**Orthodontics** (`orthoAppliance`, `orthoDrift`, `orthoVertical`, `orthoRotation`; per-tooth, gated on a present natural tooth — permanent or milk):
`orthoAppliance`: `none`, `bracket`, `band` — `orthoDrift`: `none`, `mesial`, `distal` — `orthoVertical`: `none`, `extrusion` (arrow-up glyph), `intrusion` (arrow-down glyph) — `orthoRotation`: boolean

**Tooth detail / notation settings** (global session settings, Settings → Tooth details): `wearDetailLevel` and `discolorationDetailLevel` (`ToothDetailLevel`: `simple`/`complex`, default `complex` — simple mode shows a yes/no toggle instead of the full type/cause dropdown, without mutating the stored value) and `surfaceNotation` (`simple`/`full`, default `full` — controls whether caries/filling surface letters/labels are position-aware; see "Position-aware surface notation" above)

### ⚙️ Settings
Opened from the topbar gear icon; a focus-trapped, ARIA `dialog` with a tabbed layout (Esc/backdrop-click to close, arrow keys to switch tabs). All settings are session-level UI state only, unless noted — none of them mutate per-tooth data or the export payload.

- **General:** numbering system (FDI/Universal/Palmer), language, dark/light theme, tooth-information panel visibility
- **Panels:** independently show/hide the whole-mouth Statuses card and the Orthodontics card (both default visible)
- **Tooth details:** wear detail level and discoloration detail level (simple/complex, each default complex), surface notation (simple/full, default full)
- **Caries:** ICDAS II scoring toggle (`enableIcdas`), caries-depth toggle (`cariesDepthEnabled`), root-caries granularity (`rootCariesMode`: simple/severity), secondary/CARS granularity (`secondaryCariesMode`: simple/standard/full), radiographic-depth granularity (`radiographicDepthMode`: off/threeLevel/detailed) — the former separate "Secondary caries" tab is merged into this one, with the CARS control positioned directly above radiographic depth
- **Pulpa:** pulp detail level (`pulpDetailLevel`: simple/AAE/practical-Latin, default AAE) — controls which vocabulary the "Pulp / Endo status" picker offers; changing it live-refreshes the whole-mouth summary and every open tooltip
- **Notes:** enable/disable per-tooth notes (`enableNotes`)

### 🖼️ SVG Template System

**Tooth templates** (in `src/assets/teeth-svgs/`):
| Template | Teeth using it |
|---|---|
| `11.svg` | 11, 12, 21, 22, 31, 32, 41, 42 (incisors) |
| `13.svg` | 13, 23, 33, 43 (canines) |
| `14.svg` / `14_occl.svg` | 14, 15, 24, 25, 34, 35, 44, 45 (premolars) |
| `16.svg` / `16_occl.svg` | 16, 17, 18, 26, 27, 28, 36, 37, 38, 46, 47, 48 (molars) |

Templates are rotated 180 degrees for the lower jaw and mirrored horizontally for the left side.

**Icon SVGs** (in `src/assets/icon-svgs/`):
`icon_8.svg` (wisdom), `icon_gum.svg` (bone), `icon_no_selection.svg` (clear), `icon_occl.svg` (occlusal view), `icon_pulp.svg` (pulp)

### 🔢 Numbering Systems

**FDI (ISO 3950):** Adult teeth 11-18, 21-28, 31-38, 41-48. Primary teeth 51-55, 61-65, 71-75, 81-85.

**Universal (USA):** Adult teeth numbered 1-32. Primary teeth lettered A-T.

**Palmer (Zsigmondy-Palmer):** Quadrant + position format (e.g. UR-1, LL-5). Primary teeth use letters A-E per quadrant.

### 🚀 Usage

Install the **Vue npm package** (not the React upstream repo):

#### Install as an npm package

```bash
npm install vue-advanced-odontogram
# or
pnpm add vue-advanced-odontogram
```

Peer dependency: Vue 3.5+

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import OdontogramShell from "vue-advanced-odontogram";
import "vue-advanced-odontogram/style.css";

function onLanguageChange(lang: string) {
  console.log(lang);
}
</script>

<template>
  <OdontogramShell
    language="en"
    @language-change="onLanguageChange"
    numbering-system="FDI"
    @numbering-change="(system) => console.log(system)"
    :dark-mode="false"
    @dark-mode-change="(dark) => console.log(dark)"
  />
</template>
```

See [`NPM_PUBLISH.md`](NPM_PUBLISH.md) for maintainer setup (npm token, GitHub Actions, release tagging).

#### Local development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Build:
```bash
npm run build
```
Preview:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### 🔗 Vue integration

After installing the package (see **Usage** above), embed `OdontogramShell` in any Vue 3 app. The examples below assume:

```ts
import OdontogramShell from "vue-advanced-odontogram";
import "vue-advanced-odontogram/style.css";
```

**Dark mode integration:**
- **Standalone mode:** Omit `dark-mode` prop — the component manages its own theme state via the topbar toggle button and adds/removes the `.dark` class on `<html>`.
- **Controlled mode:** Pass `dark-mode` and listen for `@dark-mode-change` — the parent app controls the theme. The toggle button still appears but emits `darkModeChange` instead of managing internal state. The parent is responsible for adding/removing the `.dark` class on `<html>`.

**Custom theme:**
```vue
<OdontogramShell
  :theme-config="{
    colors: {
      accent: '#e74c3c',
      background: '#fafafa',
      text: '#222222',
    },
  }"
/>
```

**Plugin integration:**
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import OdontogramShell, { type OdontogramPlugin, setPluginState } from "vue-advanced-odontogram";

const myPlugin: OdontogramPlugin = {
  id: "implant-brand",
  label: { en: "Implant Brand", hu: "Implantátum márka" },
  layer: "overlay",
  renderSvg: (toothNo, _quadrant, state) => {
    if (!state) return null;
    return `<text x="16" y="60" font-size="6" fill="#3b7bff">${state}</text>`;
  },
};
// Set plugin state for a tooth:
setPluginState(11, "implant-brand", "Straumann");
</script>

<template>
  <OdontogramShell :plugins="[myPlugin]" />
</template>
```

### 🧪 Testing
```bash
npm run test           # Run all 864 tests (1 additional test skipped)
npm run test:watch     # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # Coverage report
```

### 💾 Status Export/Import Format
The export creates a JSON file (version `2.10`; imports also accept legacy `1.4`, `2.0`, `2.1`, `2.2`, `2.3`, `2.4`, `2.5`, `2.6`, `2.7`, `2.8`, and `2.9` and migrate automatically) containing:

**Global fields:**
- `wisdomVisible` - wisdom teeth visible
- `showBase` - bone layer visible
- `occlusalVisible` - occlusal view active
- `showHealthyPulp` - healthy pulp visible
- `edentulous` - edentulous mode active

**Per-tooth fields (32 teeth):**
- `toothSelection` - base tooth type
- `toothSubstrate` - tooth substrate (natural/radix/broken/crownprep), orthogonal to any restoration
- `restorationType` - restoration type (none/crown/inlay/onlay/veneer/bridge)

- `prosthesis` - removable/attachment axis (none/healing-abutment/locator/locator-denture/bar/bar-denture/removable-partial/removable-full), mutually exclusive with a fixed `restorationType` of crown/bridge
- `crownLeakage` - crown marginal-leakage flag, meaningful only when `restorationType` is crown or bridge
- `endo` - endodontic state; mutually exclusive with `pulpDx` (surfaced together via one merged "Pulp / Endo status" picker — treating a tooth normalizes `pulpDx` to `normal`)
- `mods` - modifications array (inflammation, parodontal); `inflammation` is retired from the UI on present teeth (`apicalDx` drives the glyph there) but still applies to missing/extraction-socket teeth
- `caries` - active caries surfaces
- `cariesActiveDepth` - the ICDAS depth value staged by the caries-depth picker when a new surface is applied (not a per-surface stored value; see `cariesSeverity` for the stored per-surface field)
- `rootCaries` - root caries severity (none/active/arrested/active-cavitated)
- `cariesSeverity` - unified per-surface severity (0-6): ICDAS depth on a primary (unfilled) surface, CARS score on a recurrent (filled) surface
- `radiographicDepth` - per-surface radiographic caries depth (none/E1/E2/D1/D2/D3), independent of the visual ICDAS/CARS scale
- `fillingMaterial` - filling material
- `fillingSurfaces` - filled surfaces
- `fillingSurfaceMaterials` - per-surface filling material (mixed fillings, e.g. buccal amalgam + distal composite)
- `fillingDefect` - per-surface filling defect (none/marginal/fracture/wear), filled-surface-gated, independent of recurrent caries
- `pulpDx` - AAE pulp diagnosis (normal/reversible-pulpitis/irreversible-pulpitis/necrosis); reversible-pulpitis renders a reduced glyph
- `pulpLatin` - practical-Latin pulp subtype (shown by the pulp picker only when `pulpDetailLevel` is `latin`)
- `apicalDx` - apical diagnosis driving the periapical glyph
- `periapicalType` - periapical lesion subtype (none/granuloma/cyst), shown only under symptomatic/asymptomatic apical periodontitis; legacy `abscess` still accepted on import
- `resorptionType` - root resorption type (none/internal/external-cervical)
- `periImplant` - implant-only peri-implant status (none/mucositis/peri-implantitis-mild/-moderate/-severe), 2018 World Workshop staging
- `endoResection` - apicoectomy flag
- `fissureSealing` - fissure sealant flag
- `calculus` - calculus flag
- `contactMesial` - mesial contact point loss
- `contactDistal` - distal contact point loss
- `wearEdge` - incisal/occlusal wear type (none/attrition/erosion)
- `wearCervical` - cervical wear type (none/abrasion/abfraction/erosion)

- `mobility` - mobility grade (none/m1/m2/m3)
- `crownNeeded` - crown needed indicator
- `crownReplace` - crown replacement needed indicator
- `missingClosed` - gap closed after extraction
- `customStates` - plugin custom states (object, keyed by plugin ID)
- `note` - per-tooth text note (string, optional — only present when non-empty)

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for UI styling
- SVG layering via DOM manipulation (non-Vue reactivity for performance)
- Lightweight custom i18n system
- Vitest + `@vue/test-utils` for automated tests
- TypeDoc for API documentation
- Vite path alias: `@` mapped to `./src`

### 📝 Notes
- This is the **Vue npm port** of [React Odontogram Modul](https://github.com/ZoliQua/React-Odontogram-Modul). For the original React package and releases, see the upstream repository.
- SVG assets ship inside the npm bundle — host apps do not need to serve `src/assets/` separately when using the published package.
- The odontogram engine uses its own internal state (not Vue reactivity) for performance and simplicity.
- Milk teeth have a reduced set of available materials (no amalgam fillings, no pin-based endo).
- Implant teeth have a different set of crown/abutment options than natural teeth.

### 📋 Descripción general

[`vue-advanced-odontogram`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-advanced-odontogram) es la **edición Vue 3** de [React Odontogram Modul](https://github.com/ZoliQua/React-Odontogram-Modul): el mismo editor interactivo de odontograma, reimplementado como biblioteca Vue independiente instalable desde npm.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Upstream (React)** | [ZoliQua/React-Odontogram-Modul](https://github.com/ZoliQua/React-Odontogram-Modul) — editor original en React 18 |
| **Este paquete (Vue)** | `vue-advanced-odontogram` — Vue 3.5 + TypeScript, shell SFC (`OdontogramShell`) |
| **Comportamiento compartido** | Payloads JSON/FHIR, plantillas SVG, modelo de estado clínico y renderizado del odontograma compatibles con el editor React (payload versión 2.10) |

Instálelo en cualquier app Vue 3, importe los estilos empaquetados e integre `OdontogramShell` como cualquier otro componente. El motor imperativo del odontograma (estado dental, exportación FHIR, plugins) se mantiene de la línea React; solo la shell de UI se reescribió para Vue.

Renderiza plantillas SVG de dientes en capas para representar restauraciones, caries, estado endodóntico, movilidad y otros detalles clínicos, con selección múltiple, filtros y estados predefinidos.

### ✨ Características principales
- 🖱️ Selección rápida y selección múltiple (CMD/CTRL + clic)
- 🦷 Tipos de dientes: permanente, primario (de leche), implante, subgingival, ausente
- 🦷 Sustrato dental (ortogonal a cualquier restauración): natural, radix (resto radicular), fracturado, preparado para corona
- 👑 Restauraciones por tipo × material: corona / incrustación (inlay) / incrustación oclusal (onlay) / carilla / puente en e.max, oro, gradia, circonio, metal, metal-cerámica, telescópica o temporal (el onlay es solo de vista oclusal) — se eligen desde un único selector combinado "Fix: Corona – …" de pocos clics; las coronas `metal` heredadas migran a `metal-ceramic` (metal-cerámica); los implantes usan el mismo modelo tipo × material, compuesto con una capa de conector de implante. El selector se acota según el tipo de diente: un implante solo ofrece corona/puente (más sus cinco opciones de anclaje, ver abajo); un diente ausente/hueco solo ofrece póntico de puente (más removible parcial/completa); un sustrato `radix` oculta por completo el control de restauración (no se puede registrar restauración sobre un resto radicular)
- 🦿 Prótesis removibles/de anclaje en el eje dedicado `prosthesis` (entradas "Kivehető:" en el selector combinado): pilar de cicatrización del implante, localizador, localizador con sobredentadura, barra, barra con sobredentadura; prótesis parcial o completa removible soportada por dientes
- 🌉 Los dientes de puente renderizan tanto la corona como el conector de silla de montar; una superposición de tramo de puente multidiente renderiza un conector continuo y adaptado a la arcada a través de los dientes de puente consecutivos (pónticos + pilares) y los espacios entre ellos (la arcada superior e inferior usan geometría de silla espejada, manteniendo el conector alineado en ambas arcadas), incluido en la exportación PNG/JPG/SVG; añadir un puente mediante un estado predefinido recalcula la superposición de inmediato
- 🔍 Registro de caries en 6 superficies: mesial, distal, bucal, lingual, oclusal, subcoronal
- 🪥 Materiales de obturación por superficie: amalgama, composite, ionómero de vidrio, temporal
- 🏥 Un único selector combinado "Estado pulpar / endo" (agrupado: pulpa vital vs. tratada/endo): los estados endodónticos (obturación medicinal, tratamiento de conductos, obturación incompleta, poste de fibra de vidrio, poste metálico) y el diagnóstico pulpar AAE (`pulpDx`: normal / pulpitis reversible / irreversible / necrosis) son mutuamente excluyentes — un diente con tratamiento de conducto (`endo` distinto de `none`) no puede tener a la vez un diagnóstico pulpar vital; al tratarlo, `pulpDx` se normaliza a `normal` y se suprime el glifo de pulpa enferma. La pulpitis reversible se renderiza con un glifo reducido. Un ajuste opcional de 3 niveles de detalle pulpar (`pulpDetailLevel`: simple / AAE / latín práctico) muestra 9 subtipos en latín práctico (pulpa sana … gangraena pulpae) mediante `pulpLatin`; resección y pin parapulpar siguen siendo indicadores especiales aparte
- 🦴 Diagnóstico apical (`apicalDx`: periodontitis apical sintomática/asintomática, absceso apical agudo/crónico, osteítis condensante) determina directamente el glifo periapical; el subtipo de lesión granuloma/quiste solo se muestra bajo periodontitis apical sintomática/asintomática (se eliminó el subtipo redundante "absceso", ya cubierto por el diagnóstico apical)
- 🩹 Tarjeta combinada "Raíz y periodonto" (sección colapsable única para hallazgos radiculares/periapicales y periodontales)
- ⚕️ Modificaciones: inflamación periapical (visible solo en dientes ausentes/alvéolo de extracción; oculta en dientes presentes, donde el glifo periapical lo determina únicamente `apicalDx`, y en implantes, donde lo cubre `periImplant`), enfermedad periodontal, grados de movilidad (M1/M2/M3, ocultos en implantes)
- 🦷🔩 Estado periimplantario (`periImplant`: none / mucositis / peri-implantitis-mild / -moderate / -severe) — clasificación del World Workshop 2018, mostrada como un selector dedicado en los implantes; la mucositis reutiliza el glifo gingival periodontal, y la periimplantitis añade una capa graduada `peri-implant-bone-loss` (opacidad 0.4/0.7/1.0). Los implantes ya no renderizan el glifo de lesión periapical — su inflamación se expresa mediante este eje — y las casillas de modificadores periodontales quedan ocultas en los implantes (se retira el renombrado ad-hoc "Peri-implantitis" de la casilla)
- 🏷️ Indicadores especiales: corona necesaria, reemplazo de corona necesario, espacio cerrado, plan de extracción, sellado de fisuras, pérdida de punto de contacto
- 👁️ Vista oclusal, muelas del juicio, visibilidad de hueso y pulpa
- 🔢 12 filtros de selección (todos, presentes, permanentes, de leche, implantes, ausentes, superior/inferior, frontales/molares)
- 📊 Estados predefinidos (restablecer, dentición primaria, dentición mixta, edéntulo)
- 📦 34 plantillas de restauración predefinidas (puentes, prótesis removibles, prótesis con barra e implantes)
- 💾 Exportación/importación de estado en JSON (versión 2.10; las importaciones siguen aceptando las versiones 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 y 2.9 y se migran automáticamente, con estados personalizados de plugins y notas por diente)
- 🔗 Exportación HL7 FHIR R4 (Bundle de colección con Observations por diente, codificación dental ISO 3950 para dentición permanente, sistema de códigos local — mapeo SNOMED CT planificado)
- ✚ Selección de superficies en cruz (B/M/O/D/L) para caries y obturaciones
- 🧱 Materiales de obturación por superficie (obturaciones mixtas, p. ej. bucal amalgama + distal composite)
- 🖼️ Exportación de imagen PNG/JPG/SVG del odontograma (descargable; PNG/JPG rasterizado desde SVG vectorial)
- 🦷 Caries/subcaries como máquina de estados por superficie: una superficie cariada sin obturación se renderiza como caries primaria (opacidad por niveles ICDAS); en cuanto esa superficie tiene una obturación, se renderiza como caries recurrente (capa `subcaries-{surface}`, puntuada con CARS) — ambas nunca están activas a la vez en la misma superficie
- 🎯 Severidad unificada por superficie (`cariesSeverity`, 0–6, sustituye los antiguos campos separados de profundidad ICDAS + CARS): se lee como profundidad ICDAS en una superficie primaria y como puntuación CARS con nombre (Sana … Cavidad extensa) en una recurrente, mediante un popup contextual que muestra solo la escala relevante para el estado actual de la superficie
- 🌱 Caries radicular (`rootCaries`: none / active / arrested / active-cavitated), que activa la capa de ilustración dedicada de caries radicular con una opacidad según la severidad (active 0.5 / arrested 0.7 / active-cavitated completa)
- 📡 Profundidad radiográfica de caries (`radiographicDepth`: none / E1 / E2 / D1 / D2 / D3 por superficie), independiente de la escala visual ICDAS/CARS, mostrada como una insignia y recuperable mediante su propia Observation FHIR
- 🎚️ Tres ajustes de granularidad de caries (`secondaryCariesMode`, `rootCariesMode`, `radiographicDepthMode`) más un interruptor `cariesDepthEnabled`, que reducen cada escala a una vista de selector más simple sin perder el valor almacenado
- 🩹 Línea de resumen de subcaries en el panel de obturaciones: lista, debajo de los controles de obturación, cualquier diente seleccionado con caries recurrente y sus superficies (p. ej. "36 (O) tiene subcaries junto a su obturación.")
- 🪛 Defectos de obturación por superficie (`fillingDefect`: none / marginal / fracture / wear) en restauraciones directas, independientes de la caries recurrente — se registran mediante un indicador por superficie en la tarjeta de Obturaciones (espejo del indicador de profundidad de caries, con su lista de opciones apilada verticalmente), se renderizan en el odontograma y se muestran en el tooltip y en el resumen de obturaciones de toda la boca con una etiqueta explícita (p. ej. "36 (O) – Defecto de obturación: O: marginal"), igual que la caries recurrente se etiqueta en la línea de Caries; la tarjeta de Obturaciones también muestra una nota para cualquier diente seleccionado con un defecto de obturación registrado (p. ej. "En 36 hay un defecto de obturación registrado."), en paralelo a la nota de subcaries ya existente
- 🦷💥 Desgaste dental tipificado por causa clínica y localización (`wearEdge`: none / attrition / erosion, incisal/oclusal; `wearCervical`: none / abrasion / abfraction / erosion, cervical) — sustituye los dos indicadores on/off de desgaste por bruxismo; se registra mediante dos menús desplegables en la fila de desgaste, reutiliza el arte existente y se muestra en el tooltip y en una nueva sección de resumen "Desgaste" de toda la boca
- 🎨 Decoloración dental por causa (`discoloration`: none / tetracycline / fluorosis / nonvital / extrinsic / other) en dientes permanentes y temporales — tiñe la corona natural mostrada con un color representativo cuando el diente no tiene restauración y su sustrato es natural; se muestra en el tooltip y en una nueva sección de resumen "Decoloración" de toda la boca; completa el conjunto de condiciones de superficie y estructurales junto con los defectos de obturación y el desgaste
- ✏️ Los dientes anteriores (incisivos/caninos) rotulan su superficie oclusal como "incisal" en toda la interfaz (selector, popup, resúmenes); la clave de superficie almacenada sigue siendo `occlusal`
- 🔤 Notación de superficie según la posición del diente (Ajustes → Detalles del diente → "Notación de superficie", simple/completa, por defecto completa): en modo completo, la letra y la etiqueta de superficie de caries/obturación siguen la anatomía dental — oclusal → I/incisal en dientes anteriores, bucal → L/labial en dientes anteriores, lingual → P/palatino en dientes superiores y L/lingual en dientes inferiores (mesial/distal/subcoronal no cambian); el modo simple usa siempre el conjunto genérico B/M/O/D/L/SC, sin importar la posición del diente. Se aplica al resumen de toda la boca y a ambos selectores de superficie (caries y defecto de obturación), tanto la letra como el texto; la clave de superficie almacenada no se ve afectada
- 🦷↕️ Registro ortodóntico por diente (`orthoAppliance`: none / bracket / band; `orthoDrift`: none / mesial / distal; `orthoVertical`: none / extrusion / intrusion; `orthoRotation`: booleano) en un diente natural presente (permanente o temporal) — reutiliza el arte ortodóntico inactivo de la v2.5.0 (sin SVG nuevo); se muestra en el gráfico, en el tooltip y en una nueva sección de resumen "Ortodoncia" de toda la boca
- 🪨 Cálculo, y reabsorción radicular tipificada como interna o cervical externa (`resorptionType`)
- 📏 Profundidad de caries por superficie (superficial / dentina / profunda), o puntuación ICDAS II opcional (0–6) con `enableIcdas`
- 🩹 Indicador de filtración marginal de corona, visible solo con una restauración de corona o puente
- 🧰 Barra superior unificada de iconos con un modal de Ajustes por pestañas (General / Paneles / Detalles del diente / Caries / Pulpa / Notas — numeración, notas, visibilidad de paneles, ICDAS, interruptor de profundidad de caries, granularidad de caries radicular/radiográfica, nivel de detalle pulpar, nivel de detalle de desgaste/decoloración dental, información dental)
- 🗂️ Ajustes → pestaña "Paneles": muestra/oculta de forma independiente los paneles de resumen de Estados y de Ortodoncia
- 🩹 El control de caries secundaria (CARS) se fusionó en la pestaña de Ajustes de Caries, colocado encima de Profundidad radiográfica (se retira la pestaña separada "Caries secundaria")
- 🎚️ Nivel de detalle dental: un ajuste simple/complejo para el desgaste dental y la decoloración (Ajustes → Detalles del diente). El modo simple muestra un interruptor sí/no por hallazgo (desgaste activado → attrition/abrasion, decoloración activada → other); el modo complejo (por defecto) conserva los menús desplegables de tipo/causa, y el valor almacenado se conserva al cambiar de nivel
- 📋 Panel de información dental: resumen de texto en vivo de todo el odontograma (recuentos de dientes, listas presentes/ausentes, caries incl. secundaria, obturaciones, endodoncias, prótesis, implantes, estado periodontal) — visible por defecto, conmutable en Ajustes
- 🗂️ Menú de exportación unificado (Estado JSON / FHIR / PNG / JPG)
- 📥 Menú de importación con importación FHIR (recupera Bundles exportados)
- ⏳ Superposición de progreso durante la exportación de imagen

### 🦷 Tipos de dientes y estados

**Selección de diente (tipo base):**
| Valor | Descripción |
|---|---|
| `none` | Diente ausente |
| `tooth-base` | Diente permanente |
| `milktooth` | Diente primario (deciduo) |
| `implant` | Implante dental |
| `tooth-under-gum` | Diente subgingival (no erupcionado) |

**Variantes de diente fracturado:**
`tooth-broken-inicisal`, `tooth-broken-distal-inicisal`, `tooth-broken-distal`, `tooth-broken-mesial-distal-inicisal`, `tooth-broken-mesial-distal`, `tooth-broken-mesial-inicisal`, `tooth-broken-mesial`, `no-tooth-after-extraction`

**Sustrato dental (dientes permanentes):**
`natural` (predeterminado), `radix` (resto radicular), `broken`, `crownprep` (preparado para corona)

**Tipo de restauración (dientes permanentes):**
`none`, `crown`, `inlay`, `onlay` (solo vista oclusal), `veneer`, `bridge`

**Material de restauración (dientes permanentes):**
`none`, `emax`, `gold`, `gradia`, `zircon`, `metal`, `metal-ceramic` (las coronas `metal` heredadas migran aquí), `telescope`, `temporary`

**Las opciones de restauración están condicionadas por el tipo de diente** (`restorationOptions()` en `src/registry/restorations.ts`): un implante solo ofrece los tipos de restauración `crown`/`bridge` (compuestos con una capa de conector de implante) más las cinco entradas de anclaje `prosthesis` descritas abajo; un diente ausente/hueco solo ofrece un póntico `bridge` más las dos entradas de prótesis removible de `prosthesis`; un sustrato `radix` oculta por completo el control de restauración. Los campos planos heredados `crownMaterial`/`bridgeUnit` (valores de anclaje de implante/puente previos a v1.14) se retiran del modelo activo — solo se aceptan como ruta de migración de solo lectura para payloads antiguos.

**Prótesis** (`prosthesis`; eje ortogonal removible/de anclaje, mostrado como entradas "Kivehető:" en el menú desplegable combinado de restauración):
`none`, `healing-abutment`, `locator`, `locator-denture`, `bar`, `bar-denture` (anclajes de implante, con o sin sobredentadura), `removable-partial`, `removable-full` (prótesis soportadas por dientes en un diente ausente/hueco). Un diente tiene una restauración fija o una prótesis, nunca ambas — establecer una borra la otra.

**Filtración marginal de corona** (`crownLeakage`; booleano): solo se muestra cuando `restorationType` es `crown` o `bridge`; activa la capa de ilustración `crown-leakage`.

**Opciones endodónticas (dientes permanentes):**
`none`, `endo-medical-filling`, `endo-filling`, `endo-filling-incomplete`, `endo-glass-pin`, `endo-metal-pin`

**Opciones endodónticas (dientes de leche):**
`none`, `endo-medical-filling`

`endo` y `pulpDx` se presentan mediante un único `<select>` combinado "Estado pulpar / endo" (agrupado: pulpa vital vs. tratada/endo) y son mutuamente excluyentes — elegir una opción tratada (`endo` distinto de `none`) restablece `pulpDx` a `normal`, y elegir un diagnóstico pulpar restablece `endo` a `none`.

**Materiales de obturación (dientes permanentes):**
`amalgam`, `composite`, `gic`, `temporary`

**Materiales de obturación (dientes de leche):**
`composite`, `gic`, `temporary`

**Superficies de obturación/caries:**
`mesial`, `distal`, `buccal`, `lingual`, `occlusal`, `subcrown` (solo caries)

**Modificaciones:**
`inflammation` (periapical), `parodontal` (periodontal), `mobility` (M1/M2/M3)

**Tipo de lesión periapical** (`periapicalType`; califica el glifo periapical, solo se muestra bajo periodontitis apical sintomática/asintomática):
`none`, `granuloma`, `cyst` — opciones del selector; el valor heredado `abscess` sigue aceptándose/almacenándose pero ya no se ofrece en el selector, por ser redundante con el diagnóstico apical. Al importar se descarta: se incorpora a `apicalDx` si el diente tiene el modificador de inflamación, o se limpia a `none` en caso contrario

**Diagnóstico pulpar** (terminología AAE; `pulpDx`):
`normal`, `reversible-pulpitis` (renderiza un glifo reducido), `irreversible-pulpitis`, `necrosis` — mutuamente excluyente con `endo`; se normaliza a `normal` en un diente con tratamiento de conducto

**Diagnóstico pulpar, latín práctico** (`pulpLatin`; el selector de pulpa solo lo muestra cuando `pulpDetailLevel` es `latin`):
`none`, `pulpa-sana`, `hyperaemia-pulpae`, `pulpitis-acuta-serosa`, `pulpitis-acuta-purulenta`, `pulpitis-chronica-clausa`, `pulpitis-chronica-ulcerosa`, `pulpitis-chronica-hyperplastica`, `necrosis-pulpae`, `gangraena-pulpae`

**Nivel de detalle pulpar** (`pulpDetailLevel`, ajuste global): `simple`, `aae` (por defecto), `latin` — controla el vocabulario que ofrece el selector de pulpa

**Diagnóstico apical** (`apicalDx`; determina el glifo periapical):
`normal`, `symptomatic-apical-periodontitis`, `asymptomatic-apical-periodontitis`, `acute-apical-abscess`, `chronic-apical-abscess`, `condensing-osteitis`

**Tipo de reabsorción radicular** (`resorptionType`):
`none`, `internal`, `external-cervical`

**Estado periimplantario** (`periImplant`; solo implantes, clasificación del World Workshop 2018): `mucositis` reutiliza el glifo gingival periodontal; `peri-implantitis-*` añade la capa `peri-implant-bone-loss` con opacidad graduada por severidad (leve 0.4 / moderada 0.7 / severa 1.0). Los implantes ya no renderizan el glifo de lesión periapical (su inflamación se expresa mediante este eje), y las casillas de modificadores inflamación/periodontal quedan ocultas en los implantes:
`none`, `mucositis`, `peri-implantitis-mild`, `peri-implantitis-moderate`, `peri-implantitis-severe`

**Severidad de caries** (`cariesSeverity`; campo unificado por superficie, `0`–`6`): en una superficie sin obturación se lee como escala de profundidad ICDAS (`superficial` / `dentin` / `deep`, o los códigos ICDAS II sin procesar `0–6` cuando `enableIcdas` está activado) y renderiza la capa primaria `caries-{surface}`; en una superficie con obturación se lee como una puntuación CARS con nombre (`0` sana … `6` cavidad extensa) y renderiza en su lugar la capa `subcaries-{surface}` (caries recurrente) — una superficie nunca es primaria y recurrente a la vez

**Caries radicular** (`rootCaries`; activa la capa de ilustración `caries-root` en un diente presente, con opacidad según la severidad — `active` 0.5 / `arrested` 0.7 / `active-cavitated` completa):
`none`, `active`, `arrested`, `active-cavitated`

**Profundidad radiográfica de caries** (`radiographicDepth`; por superficie, independiente de la escala visual ICDAS/CARS `cariesSeverity`):
`none`, `E1`, `E2`, `D1`, `D2`, `D3`

**Ajustes de granularidad de caries** (globales): `secondaryCariesMode` (`simple`/`standard`/`full`, por defecto `standard`), `rootCariesMode` (`simple`/`severity`, por defecto `simple`), `radiographicDepthMode` (`off`/`threeLevel`/`detailed`, por defecto `off`), `cariesDepthEnabled` (booleano, por defecto `true`) — cada uno reduce su escala a una vista de selector más simple sin alterar el valor almacenado

**Indicadores especiales:**
`crownNeeded`, `crownReplace`, `missingClosed`, `extractionPlan`, `extractionWound`, `bridgePillar`, `fissureSealing`, `contactMesial`, `contactDistal`, `endoResection`, `calculus`, `parapulpalPin`

**Desgaste dental** (`wearEdge`, `wearCervical`; tipo clínico por localización, condicionado a diente natural + sin restauración + sustrato natural; renderizan las capas existentes `tooth-bruxism-wear`/`tooth-bruxism-neck-wear`):
`wearEdge`: `none`, `attrition`, `erosion` — `wearCervical`: `none`, `abrasion`, `abfraction`, `erosion`

**Decoloración** (`discoloration`; causa por diente, condicionada a un diente natural (permanente o temporal) sin restauración y sustrato natural; tiñe el relleno de la corona natural mostrada — sin SVG nuevo):
`none`, `tetracycline`, `fluorosis`, `nonvital`, `extrinsic`, `other`

**Defecto de obturación** (`fillingDefect`; por superficie, hallazgo de restauración directa independiente de la caries recurrente — condicionado a las superficies presentes en `fillingSurfaceMaterials`; renderiza la capa de ilustración `defect-{surface}`):
`none`, `marginal`, `fracture`, `wear`

**Ortodoncia** (`orthoAppliance`, `orthoDrift`, `orthoVertical`, `orthoRotation`; por diente, condicionado a un diente natural presente — permanente o de leche):
`orthoAppliance`: `none`, `bracket`, `band` — `orthoDrift`: `none`, `mesial`, `distal` — `orthoVertical`: `none`, `extrusion` (glifo de flecha hacia arriba), `intrusion` (glifo de flecha hacia abajo) — `orthoRotation`: booleano

**Ajustes de detalle / notación dental** (ajustes de sesión globales, Ajustes → Detalles del diente): `wearDetailLevel` y `discolorationDetailLevel` (`ToothDetailLevel`: `simple`/`complex`, por defecto `complex` — el modo simple muestra un interruptor sí/no en lugar del menú desplegable completo de tipo/causa, sin alterar el valor almacenado) y `surfaceNotation` (`simple`/`full`, por defecto `full` — controla si las letras/etiquetas de superficie de caries/obturación son sensibles a la posición del diente; ver "Notación de superficie según la posición del diente" arriba)

### ⚙️ Ajustes
Se abre desde el icono de engranaje de la barra superior; un `dialog` ARIA con foco atrapado y diseño por pestañas (Esc/clic en el fondo para cerrar, flechas para cambiar de pestaña). Todos los ajustes son solo estado de UI a nivel de sesión, salvo que se indique lo contrario — ninguno modifica los datos por diente ni el payload de exportación.

- **General:** sistema de numeración (FDI/Universal/Palmer), idioma, tema claro/oscuro, visibilidad del panel de información dental
- **Paneles:** muestra/oculta de forma independiente la tarjeta de resumen de Estados de toda la boca y la tarjeta de Ortodoncia (ambas visibles por defecto)
- **Detalles del diente:** nivel de detalle de desgaste y nivel de detalle de decoloración (simple/complejo, ambos por defecto complejo), notación de superficie (simple/completa, por defecto completa)
- **Caries:** interruptor de puntuación ICDAS II (`enableIcdas`), interruptor de profundidad de caries (`cariesDepthEnabled`), granularidad de caries radicular (`rootCariesMode`: simple/severidad), granularidad secundaria/CARS (`secondaryCariesMode`: simple/estándar/completa), granularidad de profundidad radiográfica (`radiographicDepthMode`: desactivada/tresNiveles/detallada) — la antigua pestaña separada "Caries secundaria" se fusiona en esta, con el control CARS colocado justo encima de la profundidad radiográfica
- **Pulpa:** nivel de detalle pulpar (`pulpDetailLevel`: simple/AAE/latín práctico, por defecto AAE) — controla el vocabulario que ofrece el selector "Estado pulpar / endo"; al cambiarlo se actualiza en vivo el resumen de toda la boca y todos los tooltips abiertos
- **Notas:** activar/desactivar notas por diente (`enableNotes`)

### 🖼️ Sistema de plantillas SVG

**Plantillas dentales** (`src/assets/teeth-svgs/`):
| Plantilla | Dientes que la usan |
|---|---|
| `11.svg` | 11, 12, 21, 22, 31, 32, 41, 42 (incisivos) |
| `13.svg` | 13, 23, 33, 43 (caninos) |
| `14.svg` / `14_occl.svg` | 14, 15, 24, 25, 34, 35, 44, 45 (premolares) |
| `16.svg` / `16_occl.svg` | 16, 17, 18, 26, 27, 28, 36, 37, 38, 46, 47, 48 (molares) |

Las plantillas se rotan 180 grados para la mandíbula inferior y se reflejan horizontalmente para el lado izquierdo.

**SVGs de iconos** (`src/assets/icon-svgs/`):
`icon_8.svg` (muela del juicio), `icon_gum.svg` (hueso), `icon_no_selection.svg` (borrar), `icon_occl.svg` (vista oclusal), `icon_pulp.svg` (pulpa)

### 🔢 Sistemas de numeración

**FDI (ISO 3950):** Dientes adultos 11-18, 21-28, 31-38, 41-48. Dientes primarios 51-55, 61-65, 71-75, 81-85.

**Universal (EE.UU.):** Dientes adultos numerados 1-32. Dientes primarios con letras A-T.

**Palmer (Zsigmondy-Palmer):** Formato cuadrante + posición (ej. UR-1, LL-5). Dientes primarios usan letras A-E por cuadrante.

### 🚀 Uso

Instale el **paquete npm para Vue** (no el repositorio upstream de React):

#### Instalar como paquete npm

```bash
npm install vue-advanced-odontogram
# o
pnpm add vue-advanced-odontogram
```

Dependencia peer: Vue 3.5+

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import OdontogramShell from "vue-advanced-odontogram";
import "vue-advanced-odontogram/style.css";
</script>

<template>
  <OdontogramShell language="es" numbering-system="FDI" />
</template>
```

Consulte [`NPM_PUBLISH.md`](NPM_PUBLISH.md) para la configuración de publicación.

#### Desarrollo local
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Build:
```bash
npm run build
```
Vista previa:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### 🔗 Integración en Vue

Tras instalar el paquete (ver **Uso** arriba), integre `OdontogramShell` en cualquier app Vue 3. Los ejemplos siguientes asumen:

```ts
import OdontogramShell from "vue-advanced-odontogram";
import "vue-advanced-odontogram/style.css";
```

**Integración del modo oscuro:**
- **Modo independiente:** Omitir la prop `dark-mode` — el componente gestiona su propio estado de tema a través del botón en la barra superior y añade/elimina la clase `.dark` en `<html>`.
- **Modo controlado:** Pasar `dark-mode` y escuchar `@dark-mode-change` — la aplicación principal controla el tema. El botón de alternancia sigue apareciendo pero emite `darkModeChange` en lugar de gestionar el estado interno. La aplicación principal es responsable de añadir/eliminar la clase `.dark` en `<html>`.

**Tema personalizado:**
```vue
<OdontogramShell
  :theme-config="{
    colors: {
      accent: '#e74c3c',
      background: '#fafafa',
      text: '#222222',
    },
  }"
/>
```

**Integración de plugins:**
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import OdontogramShell, { type OdontogramPlugin, setPluginState } from "vue-advanced-odontogram";

const myPlugin: OdontogramPlugin = {
  id: "implant-brand",
  label: { en: "Implant Brand", hu: "Implantátum márka" },
  layer: "overlay",
  renderSvg: (toothNo, _quadrant, state) => {
    if (!state) return null;
    return `<text x="16" y="60" font-size="6" fill="#3b7bff">${state}</text>`;
  },
};
// Establecer el estado del plugin para un diente:
setPluginState(11, "implant-brand", "Straumann");
</script>

<template>
  <OdontogramShell :plugins="[myPlugin]" />
</template>
```

**Campos globales:**
- `wisdomVisible` - muelas del juicio visibles
- `showBase` - capa de hueso visible
- `occlusalVisible` - vista oclusal activa
- `showHealthyPulp` - pulpa sana visible
- `edentulous` - modo edéntulo activo

**Campos por diente (32 dientes):**
- `toothSelection` - tipo base del diente
- `toothSubstrate` - sustrato dental (natural/radix/fracturado/preparación de corona), ortogonal a cualquier restauración
- `restorationType` - tipo de restauración (none/crown/inlay/onlay/veneer/bridge)

- `crownLeakage` - indicador de filtración marginal de corona, significativo solo cuando `restorationType` es corona o puente
- `endo` - estado endodóntico; mutuamente excluyente con `pulpDx` (mostrados juntos mediante un único selector combinado "Estado pulpar / endo" — tratar un diente normaliza `pulpDx` a `normal`)
- `mods` - array de modificaciones (inflammation, parodontal); `inflammation` se retira de la UI en dientes presentes (allí el glifo lo determina `apicalDx`) pero sigue aplicándose a dientes ausentes/alvéolo de extracción
- `caries` - superficies con caries activa

- `pulpDx` - diagnóstico pulpar AAE (normal/reversible-pulpitis/irreversible-pulpitis/necrosis); pulpitis reversible renderiza un glifo reducido
- `pulpLatin` - subtipo pulpar en latín práctico (el selector de pulpa solo lo muestra cuando `pulpDetailLevel` es `latin`)
- `apicalDx` - diagnóstico apical que determina el glifo periapical

### 📁 Estructura de carpetas
- `src/index.ts` - entrada del paquete npm (`vue-advanced-odontogram`; exportación por defecto + reexportaciones del motor)
- `src/App.vue` - UI principal, controles de barra superior, selector de idioma/numeración/modo oscuro/tema/plugins
- `src/SettingsModal.vue` - diálogo de ajustes con pestañas
- `src/main.ts` - arranque SPA de desarrollo
- `src/odontogram.ts` - motor de capas SVG, gestión de estado dental, interacciones táctiles, superposiciones de plugins, cableado UI
- `src/plugin.ts` - tipo `OdontogramPlugin`, `PluginLayer`, `getQuadrant()`, prioridades Z `LAYER_Z`
- `src/theme.ts` - tipo `OdontogramThemeConfig` y función `applyThemeConfig()`
- `src/status_extras.ts` - 34 plantillas de restauración predefinidas (puentes, prótesis, construcciones con barra)
- `src/i18n/` - traducciones (HU/EN/DE/ES/IT/SK/PL/RU/PT-BR) y hook i18n
- `src/utils/numbering.ts` - conversión de numeración FDI, Universal, Palmer
- `src/registry/` - registro declarativo de ejes clínicos: mapeos de campos FHIR, conjunto de limpieza SVG/activación de indicadores booleanos, matriz tipo×material de restauración, listas de opciones de UI (fuente única de verdad que genera la UI de exportación/importación, FHIR y de selectores)
- `src/fhir/` - exportación/importación HL7 FHIR R4: `toFhir.ts`/`fromFhir.ts`, sistemas de códigos, mapeos de campos, primitivas
- `src/bridgeOverlay.ts` - superposición de conector de tramo de puente multidiente (geometría de silla adaptada a la arcada)
- `src/SettingsModal.tsx` - diálogo de Ajustes por pestañas (General/Paneles/Detalles del diente/Caries/Pulpa/Notas)
- `src/__tests__/` + `src/registry/__tests__/` - suite de pruebas Vitest (864 pruebas superadas, 1 omitida, en 94 archivos)
- `src/assets/teeth-svgs/` - plantillas SVG dentales (6 archivos: incisivos, caninos, premolares, molares + vistas oclusales)
- `src/assets/icon-svgs/` - SVGs de iconos de barra de herramientas (5 archivos)

### ⚙️ Stack tecnológico
- Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS para estilos de UI
- Capas SVG mediante manipulación del DOM (sin reactividad Vue en el motor, por rendimiento)
- Sistema i18n personalizado ligero
- Vitest + `@vue/test-utils` para pruebas automatizadas
- Sistema i18n propio ligero
- Vitest + Testing Library para pruebas automatizadas
- TypeDoc para documentación de API
- Alias de ruta Vite: `@` mapeado a `./src`

### 📝 Notas
- Este es el **puerto Vue para npm** de [React Odontogram Modul](https://github.com/ZoliQua/React-Odontogram-Modul). Para el paquete React original y sus releases, consulte el repositorio upstream.
- Los assets SVG se incluyen en el bundle npm — las apps host no necesitan servir `src/assets/` por separado al usar el paquete publicado.
- El motor del odontograma usa su propio estado interno (no la reactividad de Vue) por rendimiento y simplicidad.
- Los dientes de leche tienen un conjunto reducido de materiales disponibles (sin obturaciones de amalgama, sin endodoncia con pines).
- Los dientes con implante tienen un conjunto diferente de opciones de corona/pilar que los dientes naturales.
